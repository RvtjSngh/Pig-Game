# Pig-Game
Created a captivating two-player web-based game, 'Pig Game,' using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  
Players roll a dice by clicking on 'Roll Dice' button, to accumulate scores, aiming to be the first to reach 100 points.
Rolling a 1 resets the current score, while the 'Hold' button locks in points and switches turns.
There is also a 'New Game' button, which resets the game.
Implemented dynamic updates and animations.
